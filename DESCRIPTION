Description: Weighted Deming regression, also known as "errors-in-variable" regression, 
  is applied with suitable weights. Weights are modeled via a precision profile; functions 
  are provided for implementing it in both known and unknown precision profile situations.  
  The package provides tools for precision profile weighted Deming (PWD) regression. 
  It covers two settings â€“ one where the precision profiles are known either from 
  external studies or from adequate replication of the X and Y readings, and 
  one in which there is a plausible functional form for the precision profiles 
  but the exact function must be estimated from the (generally singlicate) readings. 
  The function set includes tools for: estimated standard errors (via jackknifing); 
  standardized-residual analysis function with regression diagnostic tools for 
  normality, linearity and constant variance; and an outlier analysis identifying 
  significant outliers for closer investigation.
  Further information on mathematical derivations and applications is documented 
  by DM Hawkins and JJ Kraker on Arxiv (2025, <arXiv:2508.02888>).
